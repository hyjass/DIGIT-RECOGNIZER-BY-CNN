# Explanation:
# - *numpy as np:* numpy is a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on them.
# - *tensorflow as tf:* tensorflow is an open-source machine learning framework. tf is its commonly used alias.
# - *layers, models:* These are submodules from tensorflow.keras, a high-level API of TensorFlow used to build and train models.
# - *mnist:* This is a submodule that provides the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits.
# - *to_categorical:* A utility function from tensorflow.keras.utils that converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrices (one-hot encoding).
# - *image:* This module provides utilities for loading and preprocessing images.
# - *matplotlib.pyplot as plt:* matplotlib is a plotting library. pyplot is a submodule that provides a MATLAB-like interface for plotting.



# Explanation:
# - *mnist.load_data():* This function loads the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels.
# - *x_train, y_train:* x_train contains the training images, and y_train contains the corresponding labels (the digit in the image).
# - *x_test, y_test:* x_test contains the test images, and y_test contains the corresponding labels for testing the model.




#  Explanation:
# - Normalization: The pixel values in the images range from 0 to 255. We normalize these values to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255. This helps the model train faster and perform better.
# - *astype('float32'):* Converts the pixel values to 32-bit floating-point numbers.


# Explanation:
# - *np.expand_dims(x_train, -1):* Adds an extra dimension to the data. The original shape of x_train is (60000, 28, 28). After expanding dimensions, the shape becomes (60000, 28, 28, 1). The extra dimension represents the single color channel (grayscale).
# - Why expand dimensions? Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) expect input data to have 4 dimensions: (batch size, height, width, channels).



# Explanation:
# - One-hot encoding: The labels y_train and y_test are originally integers (0-9). One-hot encoding converts these integers into a binary matrix. For example, the label 3 becomes [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
# - *to_categorical(y_train, 10):* Converts the labels to one-hot encoded format. The 10 indicates there are 10 classes (digits 0-9).




# Explanation:
# - *models.Sequential():* This creates a linear stack of layers, where each layer has one input tensor and one output tensor.
# - Layers:
#   - *Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)):* 
#     - Conv2D: A convolutional layer that applies 32 filters (or kernels), each of size 3x3, to the input image.
#     - activation='relu': ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function, which introduces non-linearity by setting all negative values to zero.
#     - input_shape=(28, 28, 1): The input shape expected by this layer (28x28 pixels with 1 color channel).
#   - *MaxPooling2D((2, 2)):* A pooling layer that downsamples the input by taking the maximum value in each 2x2 window, reducing the spatial dimensions by half.
#   - *Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'):* Another convolutional layer with 64 filters of size 3x3.
#   - *MaxPooling2D((2, 2)):* Another pooling layer to further reduce spatial dimensions.
#   - *Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'):* A third convolutional layer with 64 filters.
#   - *Flatten():* Flattens the 3D output from the convolutional layers into a 1D vector, preparing it for the fully connected (dense) layers.
#   - *Dense(64, activation='relu'):* A fully connected layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation.
#   - *Dense(10, activation='softmax'):* The output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit). The softmax activation function ensures the output is a probability distribution over the 10 classes.







# Explanation:
# - *model.compile():* Configures the model for training.
# - Parameters:
#   - *optimizer='adam':* Adam is an optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate during training to achieve faster convergence.
#   - *loss='categorical_crossentropy':* Categorical Crossentropy is the loss function used for multi-class classification. It measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution (one-hot encoded labels).
#   - *metrics=['accuracy']:* Accuracy is the metric used to evaluate the model's performance during training and testing.






# Explanation:
# - *model.fit():* Trains the model for a fixed number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset).
# - Parameters:
#   - *x_train, y_train*: The training data and corresponding labels.
#   - *epochs=5*: Number of times the model will cycle through the entire training dataset.
#   - *batch_size=64*: Number of samples per gradient update. The dataset is divided into batches, and the model weights are updated after each batch.
#   - *validation_data=(x_test, y_test)*: The validation data used to evaluate the model after each epoch. This helps monitor the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data during training.






# Explanation:
# - *model.save('mnist_digit_model.h5'):* Saves the trained model to a file. The file can later be loaded to make predictions without retraining the model.





# Explanation:
# - *load_and_preprocess_image(filepath):* A function that loads and preprocesses an image to make it suitable for input into the trained model.
# - Steps:
#   - **`image.load_img(filepath, color_mode="grayscale", target_size=(28,28)
